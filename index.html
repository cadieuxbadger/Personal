                <p>
                    I was born in Boston, MA in July of 2001, but I have lived all over the country throughout my childhood, including attending 10 different schools. I graduated from Texas A&M in August 2023 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I have found a passion for front-end development through Accessibility and Capstone Design classes throughout my time in College, and would like to pursue this passion as a career (a major reason why I'm building this website as a post-grad passion project). I am currently working as an IT Operations Specialist for Miracle-Ear, and I have been in this postiion since December 2022, where I started as a winter intern.

                    Outside of building websites in college, my interests include playing saxophone, house plants, playing video games, and watching sports! I am also a member of a bowling league, and have been playing "seriously" for over a year now.

                    <li> <strong>Makeup Matchr:</strong> A 6-week, 5-person Capstone Design Project to make a mobile-friendly solution to finding cosmetic foundation that best matches one's skin tone. This was made in Django (Python/HTML/SQL) and utilized a scratch-made color picker, KNN-style matching algorithm, and an Adobe-developed color correction algorithm. Originally hosted on https://matchr.makeup, but has been taken down since the end of the project.

                    <li>  <strong>Pet Stop:</strong> A 4-week, 4-person Database Systems Project to learn relational databases and SQL. We used XAMPP (PHP/HTML/SQL) to locally host this project, meant to match pet owners - which had their pets linked to their accounts - with pet sitters - who listed which types of pets they'd like to watch. This took each users' calendars and pet types into account to find matching user, and presented pet owners with a list of available sitters, along with reviews about each one.

This website is hopefully the first of many post-graduation projects that I will embark on to showcase my web design abilities. This is currently made in raw HTML/CSS, and hosted using Github's Pages service for free online hosting.
