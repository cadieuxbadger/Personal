                <p>
                    I was born in Boston, MA in July of 2001, but I have lived all over the country throughout my childhood, including attending 10 different schools. I graduated from Texas A&M in August 2023 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I have found a passion for front-end development through Accessibility and Capstone Design classes throughout my time in College, and would like to pursue this passion as a career (a major reason why I'm building this website as a post-grad passion project). I am currently working as an IT Operations Specialist for Miracle-Ear, and I have been in this postiion since December 2022, where I started as a winter intern.

                    Outside of building websites in college, my interests include playing saxophone, house plants, playing video games, and watching sports! I am also a member of a bowling league, and have been playing "seriously" for over a year now.
